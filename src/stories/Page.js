        Render pages with mock data. This makes it easy to build and review page
        states without needing to navigate to them in your app. Here are some
        handy patterns for managing page data in Storybook:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use a higher-level connected component. Storybook helps you compose
          such data from the "args" of child component stories
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble data in the page component from your services. You can mock
          these services out using Storybook.
        </li>
      </ul>
