We will provide an overview and introduce the core concepts of bi(OS).[^1] We will then describe how bi(OS) helps in the entire data life-cycle -
Onboard, Process, Consume and Operate. Finally, we will conclude with enterprise-ready capabilities of bi(OS). The appendices cover reference guides to <span style="font-family:Courier New;">isQL&trade;</span>
and <span style="font-family:Courier New;">SQL</span>, and apps built atop bi(OS).

"Zero-to-production in 4 weeks or less" is our commitment to you. Let’s build!
