</p>

* Data Onboarding / Tagging  — Unified and adaptive data definition and integration across UI, APIs, 3rd-party SaaS and internal data sources.
* Scale-out Multi-model data store — A single multi-model data store with p99 < 10 ms. instead of managing the overhead of polyglot persistence.
* Real-time Feature Store —  Real-time feature store with deterministic backfilling, and change data capture, supporting stringent p99 SLAs.
* Real-time Data Science — Configurable TTL for data persistence allows Data Scientists and ML Engineers to validate their ML models with zero sampling and deploy them into production within hours.
* Data Catalog/Observability — Measure data/model drift and adjust in real-time using auto computed streaming aggregations. Track model drift via streaming alerts. 
* DataOps — Dynamic schema changes and versioning (during ingestion). Smart indexing and backfilling post schema changes.
* ELT++ - Ingest data from multiple data sources, and export it to cloud data warehouses/lakes in Parquet format.
* Real-time BI - Visualize data in motion by integrating traditional and custom BI tools.
