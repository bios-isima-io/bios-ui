While bi(OS) stores[^48]  raw data into <span style="font-family:Courier New;">signals</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier New;">contexts</span>, most of the values come from defining features with one of five flavors - indexes, aggregations, data sketches, feature-as-context, and audit logs.[^49]  The following sections cover each of these.

[^48]: Most of this section applies to signals. Some early capabilities for <span style="font-family:Courier New;">contexts</span> are supported and undocumented. <br/>
[^49]: Except for audit logs, the data is computed by bi(OS) periodically at a user-defined frequency. <br/>
