# Improve

bi(OS) has been validated in Telco, Finance, eCommerce, and healthcare industries for various use cases and is in
production across five countries and two continents.  Here are a few examples of use cases that bi(OS) has supported.

### Marketing Spend (Google Ads, Google Shopping, FaceBook Ads)
bi(OS) can be used to track and improve marketing spend, impressions, and clicks in real-time.  bi(OS) also provides
a marketing pack to do just that across Google Ads, Google Shopping, and Facebook.  See Appendix C for more information.

* Recommender Systems
  Imagine being recommended products on Amazonâ€™s home page in real-time based upon your browsing history up to the
  milli-second.  Unicorns are using feature-as-context (as described above) to implement such recommendation engines.
* Alerting and Preemptive Maintenance for SaaS
  Customers can monitor a host of 3rd-party SaaS services and generate alerts when they notice anomalies in traffic data,
  latency, browsing patterns, and error rates. These allow DevOps and business teams to react in real-time and perform
  preemptive maintenance if possible.
* Build-your-own Data|ML|Systems Observability
  Given the flexibility of bi(OS), most customers can use it for data, ML and systems observability out of the box.
  In fact, Isima uses bi(OS) for all of those observability needs and also for billing purposes.  See the observe
  section below and Appendix C for more information.
* Supply Chain Optimization
  Most retailers struggle with providing the best fulfillment experience for customers.  It is due to data silos between
  order management, inventory, logistics, and shipping systems.  Unicorns have used bi(OS) to assemble all data
  self-serve to build out-of-bound fulfillment capabilities in their warehouse management systems within weeks.
* Churn Prediction
  Telcos have used bi(OS) to predict customer churn and deliver near-real-time nudges to prevent it.
* Dynamic Interest Rate
  Fintech lending relies on accurately pricing the creditworthiness of an anonymous session alongside data from
  multiple 3rd-party credit bureaus.  Developers can use bi(OS) to combine data from all these sources to  deliver
  a nuanced solution, giving an interest rate per applicant that adapts in real-time.
