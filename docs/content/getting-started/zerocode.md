# Zero-code capabilities to onboard, process, and operate data

## Onboard

* JSON/CSV discovery/inference from MySQL, Kafka, and MongoDB
* Pre-ingest column-level constraints to enforce data quality
* Built-in push/pull connectors with an extensible framework

## Process

* Pre-insert/upsert safe and deterministic execution of Python UDFs
* Support for a variety of joins pre-ingestion and during querying
* User-defined indexing and aggregation with built-in per-column inference and auto computation of 25+ features (quantiles, frequencies, distinct counts etc.)

## Operate

* Built-in observability of throughput, latency, data errors, audit logs, billing with user-defined/streaming alerts
* In-production schema edits, with deterministic feature backfilling
* Data export in parquet format to cloud data ware/lake houses
