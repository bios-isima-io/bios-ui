## Hyper-converged
bi(OS) converges all aspects of dataâ€™s life cycle within a single, cohesive platform.  This hyper-converged
architecture delivers a multiple-orders-of-magnitude leap in impact, efficiency and governance.  It allows a
data analyst to deliver impact into production within days for deterministic real-time applications.

## Low-code
Most actions necessary within a data life-cycle can be achieved declaratively within bi(OS) via JSON/Python or
its mobile-friendly UI.  Further, developers and analysts can extend most of the functionality using <span style="font-family:Courier New;">isQL</span>. A newbie data analyst with 2 years of experience can deliver real-time impact within a few days using bi(OS).

## Real-time
bi(OS) advocates real-time data processing to deliver a quantum leap in efficiency.  Developers can perform on-the-fly processing, joins, and validation
before data is persisted.  These capabilities and the declarative features of bi(OS) to compute indexes, aggregations, and sketches, imply little need for batch[^10] processing.


[^10]: Imagine 95% of ETL converted to real-time bi(OS) UDFs, enrichments and validation.  The remaining 5% become micro-batches. <br/>
